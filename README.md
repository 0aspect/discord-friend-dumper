# Discord Friend Dumper

```This is a selfbot meaning the usage of this script could result in your account being terminated. Use at your own risk.```

This selfbot script prints all your friends you have added to a text file plus their user id.

As far as I know this wont work with discord.py as they have stopped supporting selfbots and their project entirely. I believe pycord works but there is a large amount of Discord API wrappers and most should work.
